I analyzed the data of a PHONE STORE with branches in 10 cities in USA with the use of two python libraries which are PANDA and MATPLOTLIB.
I merged 10 files together.
Cleaned the data by removing NaNs and empty rows/columns.
Grouped months, hours and cities by using the groupby feature of PANDA.
I plot the graph with the use of matplotlib.
